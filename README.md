<h2 align="left">ðŸŽ“ Experience: </h2>
<p align="left"> I recently completed a Software Engineering Immersive Program through General Assembly, over the course of 3 months, learning several languages and completing multiple projects, take a look at them in my repo!
I thoroughly enjoy putting my skills to work and developing new projects, and particularly enjoy the Frontend side of development and directly building out sleek and functional UI for users to interact with. I am excited to land my first Software Engineering role, and put my skills to the test! </p>
